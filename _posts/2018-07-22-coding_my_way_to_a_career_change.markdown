Let's take this way back way way back to back in the day when AOL started mailing those dial up CD's. I was figuring out how to maintain the free trials because my Mom was NOT going to pay for it! I also was the person my family and friends came to troubleshoot and fix their PC's. My Uncle was also a Computer Wiz so I would go hang with him, not really knowing all the technical terms just that I made things work.

Fast forward a few years I picked a C+ class in my senior year of high school although I enjoyed it, I was bored and to be honest none of my friends thought it was cool, so what did Ido?! I dropped it. I sort of regret it but it also motivated me when I'm frustrated I remind myself if I could've did it then I can do it now!

Now let's skip ahead a decade plus some. I am currently a Home Health Nurse, I been in Healthcare for 11 years. I am also a Mom of 2 boys who play sports year-round. The toll of missing income to make sure they attended their games and me getting burnt out from working 50+ hours most weeks really starting weighing on me. I decided to start researching different careers that would allow me to maintain our busy traveling schedule and continue to make money. I came across Skillcrush and a few conferences. So initially I signed up for Skillcrush, I enjoyed it but it lacked the academic support I really need. I also spent the last year attending as many conferences and meetups I could. My goal was to attend a bootcamp within the next 3 year but I received a scholarship opportunity that I couldnâ€™t turn down and here we are!
