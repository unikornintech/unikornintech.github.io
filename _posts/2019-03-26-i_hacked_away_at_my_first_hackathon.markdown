This past weekend I attended my very first hackathon. Sixth Baltimore Hackathon in Baltimore MD. The tracks available were Software, Hardware and Civil Tech. Prior to attending I didn’t know anyone personally, just a few social media interactions so I was nervous, to say the least. I felt my only option was to join a team instead of making my own and thankfully I did. 

I didn’t know how I was going to contribute, my only real experience is HTML, CSS, and some Ruby. I am in a self-paced online bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development. Let's just say we all know imposter syndrome is real. Ruby on Rails and React were chosen to build the website. Unfortunately, I didn’t have experience with either, but being the risk taker that I am decided I was going to crash course React(which I did Friday and Saturday morning). Instead of focusing my energy on the fact that I didn’t know the framework but knowing I’ll be circling back in the future with my curriculum and I’ll be ahead of the game. 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is Declarative, it designs simple views for each state in the application, and efficiently updates and renders the right components when the data changes. React is the Component Based, it builds encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compromise them to make complex UIs. React also allows you to develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. 

React consists of two Components. Simple Component: React components implement a render ( ) method that takes input data and returns what to display. Input data is passed into the component can be assessed by render ( ) via this.props. Stateful Component: in addition to taking input data(accessed via this.props), a component can maintain internal state data(accessed via this.state). When a component’s state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking render ( ).

Along with React, I dabbled with Grommet: react-based framework that provides accessibility, modularity, responsiveness, and themes in a tiny package. Next I played with SASS: CSS with super strength.

I spent approximately 12 hours coding, most I spent coding at one time. My teammates were extremely and assisted with the learning experience. While I don’t feel like I contributed much to the project I was grateful for the entire experience. 

My tech journey has pushed me outside of my comfort zones I never imagined pushing through and ones I didn’t know I had. The team and I agreed on meeting up in the future and continuing on working on it, and to be teammates in future local hackathons.
