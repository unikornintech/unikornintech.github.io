								November 8, 2018

I am enrolled in Flatiron School Online Web Development Bootcamp. The curriculum covers Ruby, HTML & CSS, SQL, Rails, React and JavaScript to name a few languages. I’ve been enrolled since July of this year. Starting off the labs were fairly easy since I already knew the basics of HTML & CSS and JavaScript, the further I progressed the more difficult the labs became, but that’s what I signed up for.

My most difficult lab to date has been Tic Tac Toe. In the beginning building stages, it faired well, solving the errors weren’t so difficult. The further along in building the board specifically using OO(Object Oriented) the more stressed I became. Understanding the errors started looking like I was reading Mandarin. I watched videos provided by the school, attending Study Groups but it just wasn't clicking. At one point I was stuck on one error message for 2 weeks, technically almost 3 but who's counting. I started questioning my decision to become a Developer, Was I smart enough? How in the World and I going to remember all of the instances, methods, objects, etc not to mention I'm only one Ruby and I still have several more languages to learn. No matter how many videos I watched, books and blogs I've read I was still frustrated and unable to retain anything. 

Asking for help has never been a strength of mine, it is actually is a weakness I struggle significantly with. I would talk to my peers and Educational Coach, I knew what I needed to ask for help just physically couldn't bring myself to do it. I knew to be successful both in this bootcamp and this career change I had to get over myself. I finally used AAQ on the program's platform and seeked assistance, it didn't end well. I ended up more frustrated and confused but luckily for me I came across a student who volunteered her time to help tutor me. That session was the biggest blessing and turning point for me on this journey. Not only was I able to work through the lab but having a Rubber Dickie was the best ever. 

Not only did Intro to Ruby but Tic Tac Toe specifically teach me more about this roller coaster developer but helped me with my personal development as well. 

In closing, I have been bent but not broken. I haven't given up and I learned that this journey will shape and develop me nothing professionally and personally. Never be afraid to ask for help. Don't be afraid to try different avenues and learn and master your learning style. What may work for someone else may not work for you but you still may learn something. 

Ruby, I am NOT done with you yet!

P.S. If you have any Ruby resources that you absolutely love please feel free to share! 

Peace & Blessings
