It’s been about 2 weeks since the 2018 Write/Speak/Code Conference and I am all download and decompressed and ready to share my experience.

Before I start, have you heard of Write/Speak/Code? Write/Speak/Code is an intensive, four-day hands-on conference with workshops, personalized feedback sessions, panels and talks by talented women and non binary coders. Attendees left the conference having developed blog posts, conference talks, open source contributions, tons of networking and newly formed friendships. 

I started this tech journey a little over a year ago, I am transitioning from Healthcare so a very non traditional path. I’ve been trying to attend every conference no matter how big or small to gain as much knowledge and network with as many people as possible. As a introvert attending conferences are a huge step for me. For months I was excited about attending but as the date got closer my anxiety grew and grew, days before I almost canceled the entire trip. Fear and self doubt set in hugely but I am a huge advocate for being comfortable being uncomfortable so I had no choice but to take my own advice. I prayed for opportunities like this so it was time to show up.
	Each day of the conference is themed! Write/Visibility Day, Speak/Leadership Day, Code/Project Day and Growth Day. Day one was Write Day, I had to write a blog post, wasn’t easy but I talked about avoiding burn out when becoming a career changer. Day two  was the doozy! I had to write and give a 5-10 minute lightning talk. I was so discouraged, those negative self-sabotaging thoughts crept in and took over my brain. I just started writing and telling my story. I got long winded and my thoughts were scattered all over the place but my mentor Crystal Martin talked me through it. I finally finished it, gave the speech in front of my group and even submitted to give the talk in front of the entire conference attendees! Now I always had a goal to submit a CFP but never had the confidence. Thanks to W/S/C and Crystal Martin especially, I know have the tools, resources and confidence to start.
	Day three was Code Day, you picked which workshop you wanted to attend. Some of the options were open source projects and personal project coding. I chose Rapid Prototyping/Hackathon skills. The goal was to build a Node.js web app using Express. I chose that workshop because Node is apart of my curriculum at The Flatiron School so I was trying to be proactive. It took me awhile to set up my environment so when I finally looked up ready to start I was already so far behind. I became extremely overwhelmed and I got up and left. I am learning that when my emotions are high I need to step back, reevaluate and take a different direction. I decided to work on a labI had been stuck on and finally got through that. 
	Day four was Growth Day, we reflected on our time at the conference  and all we accomplished. There were some amazing talks especially from Tiffany Mikell and Kortney Ziegler who drove 15 hours from Chicago after their flight got canceled at the last minute.
	Overall the conference was great! I am glad I went! I made great connections, got some great leads for companies to look at when I’m ready for that step. Attending this conference put everything into perspective and despite the emotional roller coaster I know I am on the right path with this transition. This journey won’t be easy but I haven’t met a hill that I can’t climb. I am already excited for next year and the growth I will have then.
	I want to hear from you! What conference, meetup or event confirmed you were on the right path with tech? Can’t wait to hear all about it.

Peace & Blessings,
