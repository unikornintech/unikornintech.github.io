It’s been a week since I’ve attended my first Grace Hopper Celebration! What is [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) you ask?! It is the world’s largest gathering of women technologists! I received a Complimentary Registration pass for women from underrepresented groups and what an honor. The experience truly humbled me, being surrounded by 20,000 brilliant women truly put my energy on another level! 

There were so many takeaways that gave me the chills that I don’t even know where to start. From the opening to closing keynotes, I felt a rush that I never felt before. As a true introvert events always give me anxiety let alone attending an event of this magnitude. Usually, before big events, I try to find ways to get out of going but this time felt different. I didn’t want to back out I actually wanted to go, so that was a good sign from the Universe right?! WRONG! The morning of my departure, my flight was delayed twice, I thought oh here we go, but I didn’t let it discourage me, I utilized my time wisely. Once I arrived in Houston I literally could not get a ride from the airport. Uber and Lyft were extremely overbooked, drivers kept accepting the ride then declining it. I started to get discouraged maybe this trip wasn’t meant to be. I missed the First Timer’s Orientation, but luckily my friends were there and took notes for me. I finally got to the Convention Center picked up my badge and then headed to a Squarespace event that was focused on mindfulness. It definitely was needed after the day I had and was a great start for the busy week I was about to endure. 

The Opening keynotes were amazing especially Jessica Matthews[https://twitter.com/jessomatt], I doubt anyone walked out of there not feeling more inspired and questioning how they can have a social impact change. The sessions offered were great and tailored to wherever you are in your journey-Student, Entry, Mid, and Senior. The energy was so amazing, no matter if you came alone or attended with a group, I’m sure everyone chatted with strangers and felt at peace. Even the introvert that I am, I found myself just making conversation with any and everyone. The booths of all the companies hiring were also amazing! The companies definitely sent some of their best recruiters. 

I won’t get too far in depth with the session with Professor Anita Hill but she was amazing and with the current state of the government it is what a lot of women needed. 

The closing keynote was just as great, very funny and motivating. The choir was amazing( I just realized I used amazing a lot but what can I say lol). 

The Grace Hopper Celebration 2018 was a great experience for me! I am still a student in my bootcamp so I wasn’t actively searching for opportunities but was more focused on interviewing companies for future references. I hope I am blessed to attend next year as a bootcamp graduate and who knows I may even submit a workshop. If you have the opportunity you definitely want to attend Grace Hopper, you won’t be disappointed!!! Next year it is October 2-4 2019 in Orlando, Fl, hopefully, I will see you there

Thank you for reading!

Peace and love,
