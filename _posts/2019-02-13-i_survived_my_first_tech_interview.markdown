It’s been almost 2 years since I started this tech journey and its’ definitely been a rollercoaster ride. Highs include making great friends, attending some of the greatest conferences on Earth and learning. Lows were(sometimes still) self-doubt and time. Yet even with the lows, I wouldn’t change a step on this journey whatsoever. 

I’ve reluctantly applied for developer positions in the past few months, although I didn’t think I was ready, I had to rip the bandaid off. Out of 5 applications, I received 1 response. I completed the take-home test and I knew I failed horribly (Why?! is a blog post for another time). I took a few months off from applying and focused on my bootcamp. I then came across an apprenticeship position. The perfect position to use my current knowledge and learn new things. I went back and forth about whether to apply but when my good good accountability partner(Thanks Michelle) sent it to me I knew I had to go for it. I saw this same position last year but let imposter syndrome get the best of and didn’t apply. Not this year, I made a deal with myself that I had to do whatever made me uncomfortable to help myself grow, so I APPLIED!!!  Honestly, I didn’t expect a response, either way, I was content with knowing I put myself out there.

A few days later I received an email that I made it to the next round. I couldn’t believe it! My resume was actually looked at. The next round included my profile being looked at anonymously by the team. A few days later I received another email, I made it to the interview phase. Out of 90 applicants, I made it to the interview phase!!! What?! I was in shock! Then the anxiety and panic crept in, was I ready?! Either way, it was too late. I wanted this opportunity, it was time to walk in my truth. 

I received my exercise needed to prepare for the interview. It almost sent me over the ledge, see I wasn’t familiar with the work that was assigned. But it wasn’t time to dwell I needed to jump in and give it my all. I took to Google, my Twitter community and talked to friends with that knowledge base. Then I dug in, I also ended up purchasing a Udemy course and began my crash course. I won’t sugar coat it, it was one of the most stressful things I’ve ever faced. I questioned my abilities, questioned my journey and lost sleep. It didn’t matter that I was telling myself that I was smart enough, it didn’t matter my support system was encouraging me, the stress and anxiety had literally taken over, emotionally and physically. 

The night before the interview I had constant self-talks and just let it go. Whatever was meant to happen, would. I continued to prepare. That morning I was extremely anxious, I could barely breathe, I had to force myself to eat breakfast. I had to commute to my interview, so I took that time to review my presentation and I mediated. I love mediation but I am not consistent, but for whatever reason, it was a game changer that day. I felt like a million bucks and was content in my soul. 

The interview lasted about 90 minutes. My nerves were shot and I noticed my voice was a little shaky during my presentation but I gave it my all. All in all, I think I did pretty well all things considered. See the thing is I am transitioning from Nursing to Software Development so the interviewing process is a completely different beast. Unfortunately, I didn’t get the job and the disappointment hit me harder than I expected but I am content. I stepped up and did what I needed to do to grow both professionally and personally. I learned about the tech interview process and added QA knowledge to my database.

Most importantly I learned how to handle my Mental Health for the next time.

Because I love quotes I’ll end with this one,
	he who has begun has half done-Horace
